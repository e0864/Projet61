      I loved to play basketball ever since I was 9. Yep I started playing basketball at 9, I was not that good at the start but when I continued and started my first game I became better. I remember when I made my first goal, I was so happy even by dad was to. So I begined to practice more and more, improving in skill more and more. Until when I became who I am know. A dude who likes basketball!

          Practice
          </div>
                     In practice our coach starts with a warmup, high knees, crab walk, karaoke
          and more. After that our coach gives us balls to start dribbling, then we start with right hand dribbles up and down the 
          court, left hand dribbles up and down the court then our coach places pylons in the middle of the court and then we start 
          crossovers up and down the court starting with our right hand and then crossoves starting with our left hand. Then we do 
          behind the back up and down the court starting with our right hand then after with our left hand. After that we go get a 
          drink and our coach sets up another thing to do. At the end of practice our coach usually sets up a game for us to play like
          money in the bags and meat grinder. Money in the bags is when everyone have 20 in the bag and pylons are set up all around the free throw line and each teammates stand near a plyon. The first teammate shoots if he/she misses and dosen't hit the rim, -10 in the bag
          but if he/she shoots and makes it +10 in the bag and the next person has to make it our they're out and if he/she shoots and 
          misses but hits rim no -10 in the bag and it keeps going on like that. For meat grinder we line up in different groups around
          the three point line, the first people in line will come near the net and our coach will throw the ball up to the net and the three 
          people try to rebound the ball, the person who grabs it out of the three has to grab it with two hands then pass it to their team 
          members who are lining up around the three pointer line, if the members catch it the next person from thier team comes up to rebound
          and it keeps on going on like that. If everyone in one group has rebounded that team wins and the others have to sprint up and down the court.
